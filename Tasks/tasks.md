# Task List

## High Priority Tasks
- [ ] Finalize block diagram
- [ ] Order motors and drivers
- [ ] Draft PCB layout

## Medium Priority Tasks
- [ ] Write Arduino motor control code
- [ ] Build test circuit on breadboard
- [ ] Update design decisions document

## Low Priority Tasks
- [ ] 3D print prototype chassis
- [ ] Prepare final presentation

## Dependencies
- PCB soldering depends on **ordering parts** first.
- Testing depends on **circuit assembly**.
- Chassis printing depends on **final motor dimensions**.
