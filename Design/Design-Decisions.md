## Current Design Choices
- **Controller**: Arduino Uno (chosen for simplicity and cost).
- **Power Supply**: 12V DC adapter.
- **Actuator**: Stepper motor with planetary gearbox.
- **Sensor**: Rotary encoder for position feedback.

## Alternatives Considered
- Raspberry Pi (decided against due to complexity).
- Servo motor (less torque for this application).

## Future Decisions To Be Made
- Final material for chassis (PLA+ vs PETG).
- PCB vs breadboard for motor driver circuit.
