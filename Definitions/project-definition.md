# Project Definition

## Project Title
Mini Industrial Robotic Arm

## Team Members
- Member 1 (role: electronics)
- Member 2 (role: mechanical design)
- Member 3 (role: coding)

## Problem Statement
Current robotic arms are expensive and difficult for students to build. We aim to create a small, low-cost robotic arm for educational use.

## Objectives
- Build a functional robotic arm with 3 DOF.
- Use Arduino for easy programming.
- Provide precision control using encoders.

## Requirements
- Lift at least 450 g.
- Operate on 12V DC.
- Controlled via USB or Bluetooth.
- Budget under $150.

## Constraints
- Limited time (one semester).
- Must use available 3D printing material (PLA+/PETG).
- Only off-the-shelf electronics allowed.

## Deliverables
- Working robotic arm prototype.
- Documentation (design, logs, tasks, test results).
- Final presentation/demo.

## Timeline (Example)
- Weeks 1–2: Research and planning
- Weeks 3–5: Design and parts selection
- Weeks 6–8: Circuit and code development
- Weeks 9–11: Assembly and testing
- Week 12: Final presentation
